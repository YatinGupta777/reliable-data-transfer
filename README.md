# reliable-data-transfer

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a high-performance transport-layer service using C/C++ over UDP. 
The service is designed to sustain transfer rates in the hundreds of megabits per second, even under conditions of low or heavy packet loss. 
The receiving server simulates two queues to control network parameters like RTT, link speed, and packet-loss rate, which are specified by the client during connection setup. This offers a practical approach to optimizing transport-layer protocols for efficient data transfer.
